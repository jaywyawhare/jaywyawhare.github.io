# Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena.

## Basic Concepts

Understanding qubits and superposition:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer

# Create a quantum circuit with one qubit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)

# Put the qubit in superposition
qc.h(0)

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Execute the circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print(counts)
```

## Quantum Gates

Basic quantum gates and their effects:

```python
def create_bell_state():
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    qc.h(0)          # Hadamard gate
    qc.cx(0, 1)      # CNOT gate
    qc.measure_all()
    return qc
```
