## Introduction

Modern AI applications require sophisticated approaches to handle complex tasks. We'll explore key advanced techniques that power today's AI systems.

## Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture has become the backbone of modern NLP:

```python
class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads, embedding_dim)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embedding_dim)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embedding_dim)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embedding_dim, 4 * embedding_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(4 * embedding_dim, embedding_dim)
        )
```

## Attention Mechanisms

Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input:

```python
def attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    scores = scores / math.sqrt(query.size(-1))
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
```

## Implementation Examples

Let's look at a practical example combining these concepts:

```python
# Example implementation
model = TransformerModel(
    num_layers=6,
    embedding_dim=512,
    num_heads=8,
    dropout=0.1
)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        outputs = model(batch)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Key Takeaways

1. Transformer architectures excel in sequential data processing
2. Multi-head attention allows for parallel processing
3. Proper implementation requires careful attention to dimensionality

Remember to experiment with these techniques and adjust parameters based on your specific use case.
