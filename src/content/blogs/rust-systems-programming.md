# Systems Programming with Rust

Rust has revolutionized systems programming by guaranteeing memory safety without sacrificing performance. Let's explore how.

## Memory Safety by Design

Rust's ownership system prevents common programming errors:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let ref1 = &data;    // Immutable borrow
    let ref2 = &data;    // Multiple immutable borrows are OK
    println!("{:?} {:?}", ref1, ref2);
    
    let ref3 = &mut data;  // Mutable borrow
    ref3.push(4);
    println!("{:?}", ref3);
}
```

## Zero-Cost Abstractions

Rust's abstractions compile down to efficient machine code:

```rust
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}
```

## Safe Concurrency

Rust's type system prevents data races:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Thread: {:?}", data);
    });
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Ownership system prevents memory bugs at compile time
2. Zero-cost abstractions enable high-performance code
3. Thread safety guaranteed by the type system
4. Rich ecosystem for systems programming
